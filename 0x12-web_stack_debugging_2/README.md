## Web stack debugging #2
Web debugging is the process of identifying and fixing issues on a website or web application. It is an essential skill for web developers, designers, and website owners. In this guide, we will discuss web debugging as a root user.

### What is a root user?
In Unix-based operating systems, the root user is the superuser, also known as the administrator. The root user has full access to all files and commands on the system. This means that the root user can make changes to the system that can affect its stability and security. Therefore, it is essential to be careful when using the root user account.

### Why use the root user for web debugging?
Using the root user for web debugging is necessary when you need to access and modify system files that are not accessible to regular users. For example, you may need to modify the Apache configuration file or install a new package that requires root privileges. However, it is essential to be careful when using the root user account as any mistakes made can affect the entire system.


#### Tips for web debugging as a root user
Here are some tips to follow when using the root user account for web debugging:

1. Use sudo: Instead of logging in as the root user, use the sudo command to run commands with root privileges. This way, you can perform tasks that require root access without actually logging in as the root user.

2. Be cautious: Make sure that you understand what you are doing before making any changes. A mistake made as the root user can have serious consequences.

3. Keep backups: Before making any changes, make sure to keep a backup of the files you are modifying. This way, you can easily restore the original files if something goes wrong.

4. Use a testing environment: It is recommended to test any changes in a testing environment before making them in a production environment.

5. Use a limited shell: When using the root user account, use a limited shell that only allows you to run essential commands. This can help prevent accidental damage to the system.
