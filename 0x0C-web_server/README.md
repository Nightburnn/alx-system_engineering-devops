##  Web Server

A web server is a software program that serves web pages and other web-related content to clients or users over the internet or intranet. In simple terms, a web server is a computer program that processes requests from web clients, such as web browsers, and delivers web pages or other content in response.

Web servers use the HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) protocol to communicate with web clients. When a client requests a web page, the web server receives the request, processes it, and sends the appropriate response back to the client. Web servers can also handle other types of requests, such as file downloads, email retrieval, and database queries.

#### What is the main role of a web server?
The main role of a web server is to serve web pages and other web-related content to clients or users over the internet or intranet. The web server receives requests from web clients, such as web browsers, and processes them by retrieving the requested content and sending it back to the client in the form of a web page or other web-related content. The web server also handles other types of requests, such as file downloads, email retrieval, and database queries. Overall, the web server acts as a middleman between the client and the server-side application or resource that is responsible for generating the content.

#### What is a child process?
A child process is a process that is created by another process, known as the parent process. In computing, a process is an instance of a program that is being executed by the operating system. When a parent process creates a child process, the child process is an independent process that runs concurrently with the parent process.

Child processes are typically used to perform a specific task or to run a specific program. For example, in a web server, the parent process may create child processes to handle incoming requests from clients. Each child process may handle a specific request or group of requests, allowing the web server to handle multiple requests simultaneously.

Child processes can be created using various system calls, such as fork(), spawn(), and exec(). The parent process can communicate with the child process through interprocess communication mechanisms, such as pipes, sockets, or shared memory.

When a child process completes its task, it can terminate itself or send a signal to the parent process to notify it of its completion. The parent process can then clean up any resources that were used by the child process and continue its own execution.

#### What are the main HTTP requests?
1. GET: The GET request is used to retrieve a resource or data from the server. This request is typically used when a user enters a URL in the browser or clicks on a link. The server responds to the GET request by sending the requested resource, such as an HTML page, an image file, or a JSON data object.

2. POST: The POST request is used to send data to the server for processing. This request is typically used when a user submits a form or uploads a file. The data sent in a POST request is typically encrypted and hidden from the user.

3. PUT: The PUT request is used to update an existing resource on the server. This request is typically used when a user wants to modify an existing record or file on the server.

4. DELETE: The DELETE request is used to delete a resource on the server. This request is typically used when a user wants to delete a file or record from the server.

5. HEAD: The HEAD request is similar to the GET request, but it only requests the headers of a resource, not the actual resource itself. This request is typically used to check if a resource exists on the server or to retrieve information about a resource, such as its size or last modified date.

6. OPTIONS: The OPTIONS request is used to retrieve the supported methods for a resource on the server. This request is typically used to determine what actions can be performed on a resource.

7. TRACE: The TRACE request is used to retrieve a diagnostic trace of the request-response cycle. This request is typically used for debugging purposes.

##### What DNS stands for and What is DNS main role

DNS stands for **Domain Name System.**

The main role of DNS is to translate human-friendly domain names, such as www.example.com, into IP addresses, which are the numerical addresses used by computers to identify and communicate with each other on the internet. Without DNS, users would have to memorize and enter IP addresses directly to access websites, which would be difficult and impractical. DNS allows users to access websites using easy-to-remember domain names, while computers use the underlying IP addresses to route traffic between them. DNS also provides other services, such as email routing and server load balancing.
